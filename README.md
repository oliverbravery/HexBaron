# Hex Baron: A 3D Multiplayer Remake
>[**ðŸ”— Play it on itch.io, here! ðŸ”—**](https://u3b.itch.io/hb)

Hex Baron began as a two-dimensional, single-player, command-line game created by AQA (my A-Level examining body) in C# using the .NET 5 framework. Inspired by a classmateâ€™s joking remark about seeing the game in 3D, I decided to challenge myself by remaking the game in Unityâ€”transforming it into a three-dimensional, multiplayer experience.

This remake was developed in one week during my Year 12 studies (at age 16). The result is a fully playable 3D version of Hex Baron, powered by the Photon PUN networking library for online multiplayer functionality.

## Features
- Multiplayer Gameplay: Players can join a game using a game code or create a new session. Unique usernames help differentiate players during the game.
- 3D Environment: A Unity-powered three-dimensional upgrade from the original 2D command-line interface.
- Object-Oriented Programming: The project demonstrates advanced OOP principles such as encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.

## Known Issues
As this project was completed within a week, a few minor bugs remain, such as certain user inputs not being consistently registered.

## How It Works
1. Players load the game and are prompted to:

	- Enter a game code to join an existing match,

		**or**

 	- Create a new game session.

3. Each player provides a unique username for in-game identification.
4. The Photon PUN library facilitates real-time online multiplayer gameplay.

## Reflection

This project was a fun and challenging way to apply my knowledge of Unity and networking. While there is room for improvement, Hex Baron demonstrates my ability to quickly develop functional and creative software, leveraging both technical expertise and problem-solving skills.
